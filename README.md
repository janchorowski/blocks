Bricks and blocks are Theano functions with parameters. Furthermore, the
plan is to support:

* Lazy initialization
* Dimension, type and axes-checking
* Automatic creation of monitoring channels
* Easy pattern matching to select the bricks you want in large graphs
* Application of graph transformations, such as dropout
