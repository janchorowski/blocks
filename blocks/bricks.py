class Brick(object):
    """A brick encapsulates Theano operations with parameters.

    A Brick is a group of parameterized Theano operations. Bricks can be
    considered connected, disjoint subsets of nodes in Theano's
    computiational graph.

    Bricks support lazy initialization. This means that bricks can be
    initialized by calling :meth:`__init__` with only a subset of the
    required arguments. These settings must then be set by hand later
    before calling the methods that require them (such as :meth:`allocate`,
    :meth:`initialize`), and application methods.

    To turn off lazy initialization in general set `Brick.lazy_init =
    False`.

    By default, Bricks will try to initialize their parameters when being
    applied for the first time (eager application). To turn this off and
    enable "lazy application" for all Bricks set `Bricks.lazy_apply` to
    `True`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str, optional
        The name of this brick. This can be used to filter the application
        of certain modifications by brick names. By default, the brick
        receives the name of its class (lowercased). The name is expected
        to be unique within a block.
    rng : object, optional
        A `numpy.random.RandomState` object. This can be used by the brick
        to e.g. initialize parameters.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lazy_init : bool
        `True` by default, allowing blocks to be configured in a lazy
        manner. This means that not all parameters have to be passed to the
        constructor by default. Parameters not passed will be set to
        :class:`Uninitialized` instead. Set to `False` to disable lazy
        initialization.
    lazy_apply : bool
        `False` by default, making blocks eager which means they will try
        to initialize their parameters before being applied. Setting this
        to `True` means that :meth:`initialize` needs to be called manually
        before running the compiled Theano function.
    params : list of Theano shared variables
        After calling the :meth:`allocate` method this attribute will be
        populated with the shared variables storing this brick's
        parameters.
    allocated : bool
        True after :meth:`allocate` has been called, False otherwise.
    initialized : bool
        True after :meth:`initialize` has been called, False otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    Brick implementations *must* call the :meth:`__init__` constructor of
    their parent using `super(BlockImplementation,
    self).__init__(**kwargs)`.

    The methods :meth:`_allocate` and :meth:`_initialize` need to be
    overridden if the brick needs to allocate shared variables and
    initialize their values in order to function.

    A brick can have any number of methods which apply the brick on Theano
    variables. These methods should be decorated with the
    :meth:`apply_method` decorator.

    To provide support for lazy initialization, apply the :meth:`lazy`
    decorator to the :meth:`__init__` method.

    Examples
    --------
    A simple usage of a brick is as follows:

    >>> import theano
    ... from blocks.initialization import IsotropicGaussian, Constant
    ... x = theano.tensor.vector()
    ... linear = Linear(5, 3, weights_init=IsotropicGaussian(),
    ...                 biases_init=Constant(0))
    ... linear.apply(x)

    By default, bricks have lazy initialization enabled.

    >>> from blocks.initialization import IsotropicGaussian, Constant
    ... linear = Linear(input_dim=5, weights_init=IsotropicGaussian(),
    ...                 biases_init=Constant(0))
    ... linear.output_dim = 3
    ... linear.apply(x)

    Bricks also support lazy application, which means that they will not
    try to initialize their parameters before building the Theano
    expression. This allows you to postpone configuring your block even
    further.

    >>> Brick.lazy_apply = True
    ... linear = Linear(5, weights_init=IsotropicGaussian(),
    ...                 use_bias=False)
    ... linear.apply(x)
    ... layer.output_dim = 3
    ... linear.initialize()

        created them and naming them.

        By default, application methods are eager, and will try to
        initialize the parameters of the brick. If the configuration of
        this brick is insufficient to do so, an exception will be raised
        (usually a :class:`LazyInitizializationError`). To prevent this
        from happening, one can set `Brick.lazy_apply = True`, in which
        case the parameters need to be initialized manually with a call to
        :meth:`initialize` before using the resulting Theano function.
